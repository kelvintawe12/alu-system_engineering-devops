# 100-port_forwarding
# Task: Port Forwarding from 8080 to 80

Objective:
Configure web-01 to forward incoming traffic from port 8080/TCP to port 80/TCP.

Steps:

1. Enable UFW and Allow Required Ports:
   Ensure UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is active, and allow incoming traffic on the necessary ports.

   - Allow SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), and port 8080.

   Command to run:
   sudo ufw allow 22/tcp    # Allow SSH
   sudo ufw allow 443/tcp   # Allow HTTPS
   sudo ufw allow 80/tcp    # Allow HTTP
   sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp  # Allow Port 8080
   sudo ufw enable          # Enable UFW

2. Verify UFW Status:
   Verify that the firewall is configured correctly and the required ports are allowed.

   Command to run:
   sudo ufw status verbose

   Expected output: You should see that ports 22, 443, 80, and 8080 are allowed.

3. Configure Port Forwarding using iptables:
   Create an iptables rule to forward incoming traffic on port 8080 to port 80.

   Command to run:
   sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j REDIRECT --to-port 80

   This rule forwards incoming traffic on port 8080 to port 80.

4. Save iptables Configuration:
   Save the current iptables rules to ensure they persist across reboots.

   Command to run:
   sudo sh -c 'iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4'

   If the directory `/etc/iptables/` does not exist, create it using:
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/iptables

5. Test the Configuration:
   From another machine (e.g., web-02), test the port forwarding by using curl to access port 8080.

   Command to run from web-02:
   curl -I http://<web-01-ip>:8080

   Expected output: You should see a 200 OK response, as traffic from port 8080 is being forwarded to port 80.

6. Verify iptables Forwarding Rule:
   Verify that the iptables rule is active.

   Command to run:
   sudo iptables -t nat -L -n -v

   This command will list the NAT table with the forwarding rule in place.

Conclusion:
- UFW allows traffic on ports 22, 80, 443, and 8080.
- iptables is configured to forward incoming traffic from port 8080 to port 80.
- The configuration has been tested and confirmed to work using curl.
